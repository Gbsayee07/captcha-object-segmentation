# captcha-object-segmentation
CAPTCHA Object Segmentation is a Computer Vision project designed to detect, segment, and extract individual objects (such as characters or symbols) from visually complex CAPTCHA-style images.

# CAPTCHA Object Segmentation

A computer vision project to detect, extract, and segment visual objects from CAPTCHA-like images using OpenCV.

## üß† Objective
Segment grid-like images containing objects or characters from noisy or framed CAPTCHA images ‚Äî without using deep learning.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- Frame and grid line removal
- Object extraction via fixed grid or bounding boxes
- Object filtering based on pixel density
- Visual debugging with Matplotlib
- Robust even in noisy, misaligned, or complex images
